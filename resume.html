            <u>TECHNICAL SKILLS</u> My technical skills include a high proficiency in C++ and Python, moderate proficiencies in Java, HTML, CSS, and novice proficiencies in Haskell, LaTex/ TeX, XML, XSL. I am highly proficient in wireframing and am learning how to prototype in Figma. I know the basics of Unreal Engine 4 and am currently learning more in on the Machine Learning team of SpaceCRAFT and from the UI team of <a href="https://astrocenter.tamu.edu/">SUITS</a> (click SUITS to learn more about it).<br><br>
            <u>INTERESTS</u> I am interested in UI/UX and front-end development. I enjoy art and design as my Instagram reflects (go check it out if you have not already). UI/UX serves to engage my artistic side as well as keeping me up to date with and involved in current programming practices, skills and languages. Additionally, I believe UI/UX fulfills the important purpose of allowing users across several demographics to be able to maximize their experience thereby using a product or application to its fullest. Accessibility is a critical aspect of front-end design as being able to provide those who are hard of sight an application or website that is inclusive of their needs or giving the elderly an intuitive method of receiving the information they are looking for, helps people. I want to be able to help people with the work I do. Whether it is simply by captivating the interest of your average user with interactive components that are fun and engaging or by permitting those with certain disabilities to have a productive and complete experience, I believe that more accessible design is helping people do what they want to do. <br><br> I am also interested in ML, AI, VR/AR. As I mentioned previously, I am on SpaceCRAFT on the ML team and previously did VR/AR, which I will continue to be working on in SUITS. I am also in a ML class this semester<a href="https://people.engr.tamu.edu/guni/csce421/index.html">(linked here)</a>. <br><br>
